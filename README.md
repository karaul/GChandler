# GChandler

GChandler = Garmin Connect (GG) + handler

If you are a GC user, with `gchandler` you can programmatically login into GC with your username an password and then handle it. That is, you can see  your userinfo, reveals your  list of activities, downoads the activity, etc. If it is known a GC endpoint with infornation contained,  a new item can be added into the index page.

## Motivation

Î™ hate the official GC for tons of unnecessary information, lack of the needed data thought this data is inside FIT files, slowness, ugliness, etc. And I am still learning JS.
