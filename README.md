# GChandler

GChandler = Garmin Connect (GG) + handler

It makes programmatically login into GC and then handles it: reveals user info, get a list of activities, downoad the activity, etc. If a GC endpoint with infornation contained  is known, a new item can be added.

## Motivation

Î™ hate the official GC for tons of unnecessary information, lack of the needed data thought this data is inside FIT files, slowness, ugliness, etc. And I am still learning JS.
